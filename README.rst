NIHIL is a small package which contains utilities to make HTTP services
using the Python ``asyncio`` framework. It provides the following facilities:

* ``Request`` and ``Response`` objects (Ã la WebOb, but simpler).
* HTTP protocol implementation for ``asyncio``.
* HTTP request parser.
* Request routing.

NIHIL lends itself to be used as a small web framework, by means of the
routing system; or to use the lower level components its parts for other
purposes.

One of the mails goals is to keep the package compatible with both Python
2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and PyPy.
